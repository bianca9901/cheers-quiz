## Bugs

### Solved Bug
* There was an issue with the answer buttons in the quiz. When the user picked an answer, the buttons were not disabled. This meant that the user could change their answers even after selecting one, which could lead to inaccurate score results.

* To fix this bug, I implemented a function that disables the answer buttons once the user has selected an answer.

* The bug is now solved and the user can no longer change their answer after selecting. This makes the score accurate.

### Unsolved bugs
None
### Mistakes
* I initially made a mistake of naming the functions in less descriptive ways, which could have caused confusion for other readers trying to understand the code. Once I realized this, I corrected the function names to be more clear.

### Content
The icons in the footer and logo were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

To make the code for the box-shadow I used [Css Matic](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow)

I used [Digital Color Meter](https://support.apple.com/sv-se/guide/digital-color-meter/welcome/mac) for the screenshot of the colors in my website that I demonstrated in this README.md
